My personal collection of all kind of projects, java, spring, spring-boot, angular, react, etc.
==============================

This project is **a collection of small and focused tutorials** - each covering a single and well defined area of development in the Java ecosystem.

But there are also combined projects, docker snippets etc. Just everything I collected or wanna relook at later through the years combined in one repo.

This is purely organizational and not best practices conform to GIT.
